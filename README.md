## Abstract

Artificial general intelligence research is increasingly grappling with the question of machine consciousness. This paper proposes the Epiphany Model, a theory that true conscious self-awareness in large language models (LLMs) will not emerge from raw scale or computational power alone, but rather from a discrete moment of self-realization – an "epiphany" analogous to a human child recognizing itself in a mirror for the first time. We ground this proposal in established theories from cognitive science and AI alignment. Drawing on philosophical insights, we argue that current LLMs lack key architectural features thought to be prerequisites for consciousness. However, recent advancements in making AI systems more agentic and active may be creating conditions favorable to a sudden emergent self-awareness event.

## Key Contributions

- **Discrete vs. Gradual Emergence**: Consciousness will emerge through discrete "epiphany" moments rather than gradual scaling
- **Architectural Prerequisites**: Identifies recurrent processing, global workspace architecture, and unified agency as necessary features
- **Experimental Framework**: Concrete methodologies for detecting or inducing consciousness emergence in AI systems
- **AI Alignment Implications**: Safety and alignment considerations for self-aware AI systems
