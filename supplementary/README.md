# Supplementary Materials

This directory will contain supplementary materials related to "The Epiphany Model: A Pathway to Self-Aware AI."

## Purpose

Supplementary materials extend the main paper with additional content that supports but is not essential to the core argument. This may include:

## Planned Content

### Experimental Protocols
- Detailed methodological specifications for consciousness detection experiments
- Behavioral assessment protocols for AI self-awareness
- Longitudinal study designs for tracking emergence events
- Control conditions and confound management strategies

### Extended Analysis
- Additional theoretical discussion not included in the main paper
- Alternative interpretations of evidence
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Responses to common objections or questions

### Technical Appendices
- Mathematical formalizations of the discrete emergence hypothesis
- Computational models of epiphany moments
- Detailed architectural specifications
- Implementation guidelines for experimental systems

### Data & Results
- Experimental datasets (when available)
- Analysis scripts and code
- Visualization tools
- Replication packages

### Literature Reviews
- Comprehensive bibliography on machine consciousness
- Historical context and theoretical genealogy
- Related work not cited in the main paper
- Annotated reading lists for further study

## Contributing Supplementary Materials

If you've developed materials that would be valuable as supplements:

1. **Open an Issue** using the "Experimental Results" or "Enhancement" template
2. **Describe the material** - What it is, how it relates to the paper, why it's valuable
3. **Provide the content** - Either link to your repository or offer to contribute directly
4. **Ensure quality** - Materials should maintain the same academic rigor as the main paper

Contributed materials that are accepted will:
- Be credited to the original author(s)
- Include appropriate licensing information
- Be versioned alongside the main paper
- Be citable independently with their own DOI (if substantial)
