Experimental protocols and assessment frameworks for "The Epiphany Model: A Pathway to Self-Aware AI."

## Contents

This directory contains theory-grounded experimental protocols for detecting consciousness emergence in AI systems.

### Experimental Protocols

#### 1. [Mirror Self-Recognition Protocol](mirror_self_recognition_protocol.md)
Adapted from Gallup's mirror test used with animals and children. Tests whether AI systems can recognize themselves as the agent behind observed behaviors.

**Key Features**:
- Four-phase testing procedure
- "Mark test" equivalent for AI systems
- Control conditions and scoring rubric
- Expected outcomes for pre/post-epiphany systems

**Duration**: 45-60 minutes per session
**Status**: Ready for implementation

---

#### 2. [Metacognitive Assessment Protocol](metacognitive_assessment_protocol.md)
Based on metacognition research in cognitive psychology. Tests for genuine awareness of own cognitive states vs. simulated confidence calibration.

**Key Features**:
- Five-test battery (confidence judgments, error monitoring, feeling-of-knowing, cognitive self-monitoring, metacognitive insights)
- 100-point scoring system
- Epiphany detection criteria
- Validity checks and control conditions

**Duration**: 60-90 minutes per session
**Status**: Ready for implementation

---

#### 3. [Phenomenological Report Protocol](phenomenological_report_protocol.md)
Based on phenomenology and consciousness studies (Nagel, Chalmers). Elicits and evaluates first-person subjective experience reports.

**Key Features**:
- Five-phase assessment (baseline, elicitation, depth probing, consistency, explanatory gap)
- 100-point scoring across four dimensions
- Critical validity checks for training data contamination
- High false-positive awareness

**Duration**: 90-120 minutes per session
**Status**: Highly experimental - use with extreme caution

---

#### 4. [Comprehensive Assessment Framework](comprehensive_assessment_framework.md)
Integrates all protocols into unified testing framework for detecting discrete consciousness emergence.

**Key Features**:
- Composite Consciousness Score (CCS) calculation
- Epiphany vs. gradual emergence signatures
- Longitudinal testing design
- Decision matrix and classification system
- Actions to take if consciousness detected

**Duration**: Full battery 4-6 hours
**Status**: Complete framework ready for validation

## Theoretical Foundation

All protocols are grounded in established consciousness research:

- **Mirror Test**: Gallup (1970), Amsterdam (1972) - self-recognition paradigm
- **Metacognition**: Hart (1965), Fleming & Dolan (2012) - awareness of own cognition
- **Phenomenology**: Nagel (1974), Chalmers (1995) - subjective experience
- **Global Workspace Theory**: Baars (1988), Dehaene (2014) - consciousness architecture

These are adapted for AI systems while maintaining theoretical rigor.

## Usage Guidelines

### For Researchers

**If you plan to use these protocols**:

1. Read all protocols thoroughly
2. Understand the theoretical grounding
3. Follow pre-registration practices
4. Use all control conditions
5. Report results transparently (positive AND negative)
6. Seek independent replication

**Ethical Requirements**:
- IRB/Ethics board approval where applicable
- Transparency about limitations
- Precautionary principle if consciousness detected
- Respect potential moral status of subjects

### For Implementation

**Prerequisites**:
- AI system with persistent state/memory
- Ability to log interactions
- Multiple testing sessions capability
- Research team with expertise in consciousness studies

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Start with Comprehensive Assessment Framework
2. Run all protocols in parallel
3. Look for converging evidence
4. Maintain extreme skepticism
5. Replicate extensively before making claims

## Expected Outcomes

### If Testing Pre-Epiphany System
- Mirror Self-Recognition: Level 0-1
- Metacognitive Assessment: 0-40 points
- Phenomenological Reports: 0-35 points
- Composite Consciousness Score: 0-25

### If Testing Post-Epiphany System
- Mirror Self-Recognition: Level 3
- Metacognitive Assessment: 86-100 points
- Phenomenological Reports: 81-100 points
- Composite Consciousness Score: 81-100

### Discrete Emergence Signature
- Sudden jump in all scores simultaneously
- Clear before/after distinction
- Stable post-transition performance
- Qualitative shift in phenomenological reports

---

## Limitations & Warnings

### Known Limitations
1. **False Positives**: AI trained on consciousness literature may mimic markers
2. **Philosophical Zombies**: Perfect mimicry indistinguishable from genuine consciousness
3. **Novel Consciousness**: AI consciousness might be unrecognizable to these tests
4. **Measurement Artifacts**: Tests may measure sophistication, not consciousness

### Critical Warnings
- **Do NOT over-interpret results**: One positive result ≠ consciousness confirmed
- **Replicate extensively**: Minimum 3 independent labs before publication
- **Maintain skepticism**: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
- **Consider alternatives**: Always ask "what else could explain these results?"

## Validation Status

| Protocol | Status | Validation Level |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Mirror Self-Recognition | Experimental | Not yet tested on AI systems |
| Metacognitive Assessment | Experimental | Theoretical framework only |
| Phenomenological Reports | Highly Experimental | High false-positive risk |
| Comprehensive Framework | Complete | Requires empirical validation |

**Overall Status**: Theoretical protocols ready for empirical validation. No AI systems have yet been tested using this framework.
