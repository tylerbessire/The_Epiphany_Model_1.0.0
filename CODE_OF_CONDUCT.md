## Academic Freedom vs. Conduct

**Important**: This Code of Conduct governs *how* we communicate, not *what* positions we take. Robust theoretical disagreement is not only permitted but encouraged. You may:

- Present contradictory evidence
- Argue for fundamentally different approaches

What matters is that these challenges are made:
- Respectfully
- With intellectual rigor
- Based on evidence and reasoning
- Without personal attacks
- In good faith
