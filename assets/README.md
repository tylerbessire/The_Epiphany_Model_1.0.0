# Visual Assets & Diagrams

Conceptual visualizations for "The Epiphany Model: A Pathway to Self-Aware AI."

## Available Diagrams

### 1. [Discrete vs. Gradual Emergence Comparison](epiphany_emergence_comparison.svg)

**Visualization of the core hypothesis**: Contrasts the gradual scaling hypothesis with the Epiphany Model's discrete emergence hypothesis.

**Key Features**:
- Side-by-side comparison
- Gradual: smooth continuous curve
- Epiphany: sudden discrete jump marked by "epiphany moment"
- Annotations showing AI development stages

**Use Cases**: Papers, presentations, educational materials, blog posts

---

### 2. [Architectural Prerequisites Diagram](architecture_prerequisites.svg)

**Visualization of necessary conditions** for consciousness emergence according to the Epiphany Model.

**Key Features**:
- Three architectural prerequisites:
  1. Recurrent Processing (self-referential loops, feedback)
  2. Global Workspace (information integration, unified access)
  3. Unified Agency (goal-directed behavior, persistent identity)
- Current LLMs vs. Emerging Systems vs. Required for Epiphany
- Clear visual connections showing how prerequisites enable epiphany

**Use Cases**: Technical presentations, architecture discussions, implementation planning

---

### 3. [Experimental Framework Flowchart](experimental_framework.svg)

**Complete testing pipeline** for detecting consciousness emergence in AI systems.

**Key Features**:
- Four stages:
  1. Prerequisites Assessment
  2. Self-Model Assessment
  3. Behavioral Markers
  4. Verification Protocol
- Decision points and branching logic
- Color-coded by stage type
- Notes on key challenges

**Use Cases**: Research protocols, experimental design, methodology sections
